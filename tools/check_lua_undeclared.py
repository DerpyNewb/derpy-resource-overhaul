"""Find ALL_CAPS Lua names that are read but never declared.

Flow B shipped dead because BINDING and BINDING_RITE were Python constants in
gen_commission_dilemmas.py, used to build the DB rows but never interpolated into the
Lua template. In Lua an undeclared global is nil, not an error, so every branch that
compared against them was silently unreachable - luac -p passes, check_lua_api.py
passes, and the game logs nothing at all.

    IT HAS TO BE ONE PASS, and a regex sequence cannot be. Stripping comments first eats the

    what happens then: the next person bypasses the gate.
