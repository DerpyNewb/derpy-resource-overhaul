37 trade goods (GOODS). Salted Fish alone was proven first in an IEE game - produced, on the
map label, and traded in a Trade Agreement (docs/TRADE_RESOURCES.md §10-§11). CA_GOODS makes
four of CA's own thin goods - Salt, Furs, Pottery, Wine - as common, on CA's own effects (§18).

Every row is cloned off a vanilla donor good (Salt, res_rom_lead) read out of CA's db.pack, so
the column order and versions are CA's own. A sweep of all 1,600 vanilla tables for res_rom_lead
found the tables a tradeable good lives in - resources, resources_to_campaign, commodities (the
price list - only tradeable goods have a row) and cai_personality_strategic_resource_values
(the AI's value of the good, one row per strategic component) - plus the production effect,
its resource binding, and the building rows that produce it.

Source: production rows on EXISTING buildings (CA's own pattern for a good with no deposit -
Dwarf taverns make Beer, High Elf industry makes Trinkets, both at 6/8/12 per level), each gated
by a lore condition on the building's region - see the comment above GOODS. New map deposits
would need a startpos; see the doc.

Packing needs RPFM open (--pack); it packs the TSVs on DISK, so write them first.

# WHERE A GOOD COMES FROM: a list of sources, each (pool, condition). The POOL is which buildings
# carry the production row; the CONDITION is a lore rule on the building's region, shipped as a
# building_effect_context_expressions row and named in the row's context_requirement - the way
# CA gates 11 of its own production rows (FactionHasTrade, RegionHasAdjacentDwarfFaction). So a
# good is made by the right building AND only where the lore puts it, on any map, IEE included.
#
# A condition is a small tuple tree, RENDERED to CA's expression language for the game and
# EVALUATED in Python against guess_region_commodities' region signals here - check() asserts
# the two agree region-for-region with that tool's RULES on IE and Realm of Chaos, so the lore
# table and what ships cannot drift apart.

# THE MAP LABEL. The settlement label's resource row (`resource_list` in CA's city_info_bar) is
# filled by the engine from MAP DEPOSITS only - measured 2026-10-01, Bay of Blades has a port
# making Salted Fish and its label shows nothing, and CA's own building-made Beer and Trinkets
# never show there either. So the label gets one icon per good of ours, placed right after that
# row inside `icon_holder` (a HorizontalList, so it flows), visible only while one of the
# settlement's buildings carries the good's production effect. A whole-file override of a CA
# file: re-run after any patch that touches it (it is rebuilt from the live ui3.pack each run).

# row there is one flat score per chain: the AI would put Dragon Bone Digs in any settlement, and
# outside the lore regions the building makes nothing. So the chains get NO score row (the AI
# never picks them), and this script builds them instead, for AI factions, in the regions where
# rare_cond() holds - the same condition the building's rows are gated by, evaluated here on
# every region of IE, the Realm of Chaos and IEE's own. A region whose IEE deposit or origin is
# unreadable offline reads as no, so the error runs towards not building, never towards a dead one.
#
# PLAYER-LIKE: CA's price per level (LEVEL_DONOR's create_cost), the settlement tier each level
# needs, and a treasury reserve. cm:add_building_to_settlement picks the slot itself, and the
