"""Derpy Resource Overhaul's XML emitter: a byte copy of gen_guilds_emitter.py taken
2026-10-02, kept apart for the reason below. A fix made there is ported here by hand.

The Great Guilds' XML emitter. A COPY of the Zharr Exchange's, deliberately.

WHY A COPY. gen_guilds_ui.py used to import gen_exchange_ui and call its emitter
directly, so three fixes made for the Guilds silently changed the EXCHANGE's shipped
output as well: snapping font categories to the ones the game actually has stepped
the Exchange's own labels from body_11 to body_10 on 16 panel cells and body_13 to
body_12 on 4 row cells. Every one of those was a real fix, and none of them was this
mod's decision to make for another mod that is already published.

Two mods that ship separately do not share a code path that changes what they emit.
The duplication is the point.

WHAT DIFFERS FROM THE EXCHANGE'S COPY:
  * fontcat()  - font category is a fixed 32-name vocabulary, not a number. The
    Exchange builds "body_%d" from the pixel size, which mints body_11/13/14 -
    names the game does not have. An unknown value is not an error and not a blank:
    the engine falls back, so the label draws at a size nobody chose. Here the size
    snaps to the nearest real body category, or fontcat= names one outright.
  * leading    - font_m_leading was hardcoded to 3. On a one-line button caption
    that is an offset, not leading, and it dropped the glyphs onto the plate's
    bottom rim. kw["leading"] now sets it, default 3.

Everything else is byte-for-byte the Exchange's emitter as of 2026-09-11. If a fix
here is general, port it across deliberately rather than by sharing the module.
